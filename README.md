# TypeScript Learning Playground

A beginner-friendly project to learn TypeScript fundamentals and explore its features.

## Overview

This project contains example TypeScript files demonstrating:

- Basic types
- Variables, constants
- Functions
- Interfaces and types
- Arrays, tuples, enums
- Classes and inheritance
- Type assertions and type inference

The goal is to understand **why TypeScript is used**, its benefits over JavaScript, and how it helps catch errors during development.

## Why TypeScript?

- **Type safety**: Detect errors at compile time.
- **Better tooling**: Autocomplete, hints, and navigation in editors.
- **Scalable code**: Easier to maintain in large projects.
- **Compatibility**: Compiles to plain JavaScript, so it works anywhere JS does.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git


 2. Install TypeScript globally (if not installed):

npm install -g typescript
